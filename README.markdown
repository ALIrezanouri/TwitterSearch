# TwitterSearch
This library allows you easily create a search through the Twitter Search API without having to know about the API details. Based on such a search you can even iterate throughout all tweets reachable via the Twitter Search API. There is an automatic reload of the next pages while using the iteration.


## Example
The library is still in a very early stage. However, if you would like to use it we prepared a small example about how to play around with it.

Because somehow the codeblocks don't seem to work the example is published within the [[Home|Wiki]].
